XIVAuras is a Dalamud plugin for tracking buffs, debuffs, and cooldowns in FFXIV. It is heavily inspired by the World of Warcraft addon WeakAuras.

This project is NOT associated with WeakAuras in any way.

## How to Install

XIVAuras is not available in the standard Dalamud plugin repository and must be installed from my third party repository.

Here is the URL for my plugin repository: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lichie567/XIVAuras/main/repo.json`
